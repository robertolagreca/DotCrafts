This is a project made following the Linkedin course "Introducing ASP.NET Core".
It is a simply online shop. Made using ASP.NET with the Blazor framework.

There is one bug, the first time I click one of the button to activate the modal, it does not work. From the second time it works. 
I understood where is the problem but being first time with Blazor, I can say I'm satisfied and like it.
